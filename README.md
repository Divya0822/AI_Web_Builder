# 🤖 AI Web Page Generator – KrackHack 2025

This repository contains **HTML web pages automatically generated and uploaded** by our AI agent during the KrackHack 2025 hackathon.

## 📄 What’s in This Repo?

All the `.html` files here were:
- 🧠 **Generated by an AI agent** built on **Agent.AI**
- 💻 **Saved locally** on the host machine
- ☁️ **Uploaded automatically to this GitHub repository**

> No files were manually added — this repo is a live showcase of our AI agent’s functionality.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. A prompt is sent to the agent.
2. The agent uses **Agent.AI** to generate a valid HTML page.
3. The generated file is:
   - Saved to the local machine
   - Uploaded to this GitHub repo using the **GitHub API**
4. The upload process is fully automated — no manual intervention required.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
